        <p>The <strong>Rationality Faction</strong> is a faction founded by <strong>GoobisMoobis2</strong> on 11/12/2024. It functions on a mostly <strong>Democratic</strong> system. Most decisions made will be voted on.</p>
        <p>Certain very important decisions will be handled by <strong>GoobisMoobis2</strong> directly, and members of the cabinet.</p>
        <p>Cabinet members will be voted for, too. Members of the cabinet can choose to create a community vote, as long as it‚Äôs reported to <strong>GoobisMoobis2</strong>.</p>
