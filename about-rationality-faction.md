The **Rationality Faction** is a faction founded by **GoobisMoobis2** on 11/12/2024. It functions on a mostly **Democratic** system. Most decisions made will be voted on.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain very important decisions will be handled by **GoobisMoobis2** directly, and members of the cabinet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabinet members will be voted for, too. Members of the cabinet can choose to create a community vote, as long as it‚Äôs reported to **GoobisMoobis2**.

If the faction grows enough, more special faction roles will be added, such as the strategic commander.

### Rules:
**Rule 1**: Don‚Äôt be a dumbass. (That's it for now, I ain‚Äôt strict üòå)

### Announcements:
[https://goobismoobis.github.io/RFA](https://goobismoobis.github.io/RFA) (when you join the faction you'll get the password required to see the announcements)

This faction is still under construction! It isn‚Äôt done :)
